DATA:
- `./DATA/` contains CSVs with train/test/split of plantnet, old-inat-300k datasets. They are used especially for Lorenz plots.

PLOTS:

- `./datasets_plots/` contains the big plot with all existing datasets 
- `./datasets_dependencies/` contains the who stole from whom plot
- `./inat500_geo.ipynb` contains the code for new inat500k plots for ECCV2024 (lorenz, sun-plot, etc.)
	- `./inat500plots/` contains the plots generated by it
- `./old/`
	- `./inat_ds_plots/` contains generating code + plots for the old paper, code mostly reused for inat500k
	- `frequency_plot` has unused code for scores VS training instances plot.
